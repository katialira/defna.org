I"<p>Django Events Foundation North America (DEFNA) is looking for another board member. Last year we expanded our board from three members to seven; this year one of our board members, Stacey Haysler, is stepping down. We are looking for a new board member, possibly someone interested in being our new Corporate Secretary, who manages the official records of the nonprofit.</p>

<p>Board membership takes, on average, about five hours per month performing the following functions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attend the monthly board meeting</li>
  <li>Manage DEFNA 501(c)(3) charitable organization and a registered California corporation</li>
  <li>Participate in the grant applications review process</li>
  <li>Use DEFNA’s social media channels to communicate about DEFNA</li>
  <li>Come up with new and clever ways for DEFNA to fulfill our mission</li>
</ul>

<p>If you’d like to be considered for the board, drop us a note at hello@defna.org, and let us know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What interests you about being on the board</li>
  <li>Your current/prior community involvement (it’s okay if you’re new—we need everyone to participate!)</li>
  <li>Any particular interests you have (grants committee, corporate filings, corporate secretary, etc.)</li>
  <li>Any ideas you have for expanding DEFNA’s reach in the OSS community</li>
  <li>Anything else you’d like us to know about you as a potential board member</li>
</ul>

<p>Please email your information to us by February 16 at 6:00 PM Pacific Time. We’ll contact you if we need more details. We’ll make our decision and reply to everyone by end-of-day February 26.</p>

I"z<p>Django Events Foundation North America (DEFNA) is looking for another board member. Last year we expanded our board from three members to seven; this year one of our board members, Stacey Haysler, is stepping down. We are looking for a new board member, possibly someone interested in being our new Corporate Secretary, who manages the official records of the nonprofit.</p>

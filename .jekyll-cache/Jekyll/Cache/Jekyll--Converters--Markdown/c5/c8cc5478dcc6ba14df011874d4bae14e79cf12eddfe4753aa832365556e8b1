I"Å	<p>Django Events Foundation North America (DEFNA) is looking for board members! If youâ€™re looking for a way to participate in the Django community, this may be what youâ€™re looking for!</p>

<p>DEFNA was founded to support Django professional and educational events in North America. Our main focus has been DjangoCon US, and weâ€™re looking to expand our support to smaller regional and local events.</p>

<p>To do this, we need additional people to help manage DEFNA. Our current board members (who are also the founding members) are Jeff Triplett, Craig Bruce, and Stacey Haysler.</p>

<p>Specifically, we need people to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attend the monthly board meeting</li>
  <li>Manage DEFNA business: as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization and a registered California corporation, there are annual forms and filings to complete, monthly board records to maintain, etc. as well as the usual paying bills and other general business management tasks</li>
  <li>Participate in the grant applications review process</li>
  <li>Use DEFNAâ€™s social media channels to communicate about DEFNA</li>
  <li>Come up with new and clever ways for DEFNA to fulfill our mission</li>
</ul>

<p>The day-to-day running of DjangoCon US is handled by our amazing team of volunteers. The DEFNA board is not involved in the day-to-day business; our job is to select the venue, manage the contracts, and provide direction to the organizersâ€™ team. If you want to be part of the organizersâ€™ team, thatâ€™s terrificâ€”but itâ€™s not required.</p>

<p>Board membership takes, on average, about five hours per month. You can put in more time if you want to be more involved, of course!</p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to be considered for the board, drop us a note at hello@defna.org, and let us know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What interests you about being on the board</li>
  <li>Your current/prior community involvement (itâ€™s okay if youâ€™re newâ€”we need everyone to participate!)</li>
  <li>Any particular interests you have (grants committee, corporate filings, etc.)</li>
  <li>Any ideas you have for expanding DEFNAâ€™s reach in the OSS community</li>
  <li>Anything else youâ€™d like us to know about you as a potential board member</li>
</ul>

<p>Please email your information to us by <em>6:00 PM Pacific Time on April 28th</em>. Weâ€™ll contact you if we need more details.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll make our decisions and reply to everyone on <em>May 12th</em>.</p>

<p>Thanks for your interest, and your support of DEFNA!</p>
